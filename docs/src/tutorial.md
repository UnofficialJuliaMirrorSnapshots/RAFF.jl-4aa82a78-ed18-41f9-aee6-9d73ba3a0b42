# Tutorial

```@setup docrepl
```
## Installation

This package is supported just for Julia version 1.0. Consequently, 
it uses package 3.0. Currently RAFF ins't in 
[Metadata.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl), so the 
package can be installed with the Julia package manager.
From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter into Pkg REPL mode and run:

```
pkg> add https://github.com/fsobral/RAFF.jl#dev
```

## Basic usage

Just to ilustrate the potential and basic usage of RAFF, let us consider
the following dataset given by an array ``A``:

```math
A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
 -2.0 &  5.0 \\
 -1.5 &  3.25\\
 -1.0 &  2.0 \\
 -0.5 &  1.25\\
  0.0 &  1.0 \\
  0.5 &  1.25\\
  1.0 &  2.0 \\
  1.5 &  3.25\\
  2.0 &  5.0 \\
\end{array}\right]
```

Lets suppose the first column of ``A`` as an experimental measure with 
result given by second column. It is easy to see that the fitting 
function in this case is accurate and given by 

```math
\phi(t)=t^2 +1
```

Now lets perturb one result of second column of ``A``. For example, 
consider ``A_{6,2}=2.55``. Assuming the model for fitting given by

```math
\varphi(x,t)=x_1 t^2 +x_2 
```
we have by classical least square as result `x=[0.904329,1.3039]`. But when we consider RAFF algorithm we obtain the correct answer `x=[1.0,1.0]`. Moreover, we have the number of possible outliers and which they are.

In order to get run RAFF algorithm we need to setup 
```@repl docrepl
using RAFF
``` 
and define the dataset and model:

```@repl docrepl
A=[-2.0  5.0; 
  -1.5  3.25;
  -1.0  2.0 ;
  -0.5  1.25;
   0.0  1.0 ;
   0.5  2.55;
   1.0  2.0 ;
   1.5  3.25;
   2.0  5.0 ;]

model(x,t)=x[1]*t[1]^2+x[2]
```

After that, we can run raff:

```@repl docrepl
raff(model,A,2)
```
The number `2` above is the number of variables in model.
The output is a `RAFFoutput type`, consequently is possible to handle with some atributes of this type. For example to acess only the parameters of solution, we can use

```@repl docrepl
output = raff(model,A,2)
output.solution
```

Note that `RAFF algorithm` detects and ignores possible outliers. In order to see which points are outiliers, we can acess the `outliers` atribute.  

```@repl docrepl
output.outliers
```

More details about `RAFFoutput type` and others options can be obtained in [API section](api.md). 


By default `RAFF` uses automatic differentiation, more specifically [ForwardDiff package](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl). But is possible to define and handle `RAFF` with gradient vector of model. For example, considering the above example, we have, 

```math
\nabla \varphi(x,t)=[t^2,1].
```
Programming this gradient and run raff we have

```@repl docrepl
gmodel(x,t,g)=begin
g[1]=t[1]^2
g[2]=1.0
return g
end

raff(model,gmodel,A,2)
```

## Multivariate models

`RAFF` supports fits to data sets of different sizes. To illustrate how this works, consider the following example:

```@repl docrepl
    data = [1.0 1.0   2.0
            0.0 0.0   4.0
            7.0 1.5  -4.5
            2.0 2.0 -17.0 # outlier
            0.0 8.6  -4.6]
```
and the following model

```@repl docrepl
    model(x, t) = x[1]*t[1] + x[2] * t[2] + x[3]            
```

Note that this model has two variables ``(t_1,t_2)``. Naturally, this problem has one outlier (`data[4,:]`), so there are 4 trust points. Let's run `RAFF` and check the answer. 

```@repl docrepl
    output = raff(model,data, 3)
```

The right answer is `[- 1.0, - 1.0, 4.0]`. As we can note `RAFF` get a good fit for the data set.

Handling the output follows the same pattern as the one-dimensional case. 

In order to get improvements in processing time, we can code the gradient vector of model to.

```@repl docrepl
    gmodel(x, t,g) = begin 
        g[1] = t[1]
        g[2] = t[2]
        g[3] = 1.0
        return g
    end
```
```@repl docrepl
    output = raff(model,data, 3)
```


## Changing some options

Naturally, `RAFF` has options like precision of gradient stopping criteria and initial guess. 

```@repl docrepl
    output = raff(model,data, 3;initguess=[0.5,0.5,0.5],ε=1.0e-4)
```

RAFF is based on an optimization method. In this way, it is subject to stop at stationary points that are not global minimizers. For this reason, heuristics were implemented to find global minimizers. Such heuristics depend on random number generation. So if you want to run tests with more reliability this can be a useful strategy. To define in RAFF, say, 1000 different starting points, is enough to redefine the keyword argument `MAXMS`.

```@repl docrepl
    output = raff(model,data, 3;MAXMS=1,initguess=[0.5,0.5,0.5],ε=1.0e-10)
```


## Parallel running

`RAFF` can be run in a parallel or distributed environment, using the
[Distributed](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/stdlib/Distributed/)
package and function [`praff`](@ref). Let's use `praff` to solve the
same problem from the beginning before. First, the Distributed has to
be loaded and the number of workers is added. It is also possible to
add the address of other machines.

```
using Distributed

addprocs(3) # Add 3 worker processes
```

This step can be replaced if Julia is initialized with the `-p`
option

```
julia -p 3
```

Now we have to load [`RAFF`](@ref Overview) and the fit function in all
workers:

```
@everywhere using RAFF

@everywhere function gmodel!(x, t, g)
    g[1] = t[1]^2
    g[2] = 1.0
end

@everywhere function model(x, t)
   x[1] * t[1]^2 + x[2]
end
```

then, we call [`praff`](@ref) to solve the problem (note that we do
not need to send the `A` matrix to all workers, since it will be
sent by `praff`).

```
A=[-2.0  5.0;
  -1.5  3.25;
  -1.0  2.0 ;
  -0.5  1.25;
   0.0  1.0 ;
   0.5  2.55;
   1.0  2.0 ;
   1.5  3.25;
   2.0  5.0 ;];

n = 2

output = praff(model, gmodel!, A, n)
RAFFOutput(1, [1.0, 0.999996], 6, 8, 4.0205772365906425e-11, [6])
```

The true effectiveness of parallelism occurs when option `MAXMS` is
set, which changes the number of random initial points that are tried
for each subproblem solved. Better solutions can be achieved with
higher values of `MAXMS`

```
n = 2

output = praff(model, gmodel!, A, n; MAXMS=1000)
RAFFOutput(1, [1.0, 1.0], 7, 8, 5.134133698545651e-13, [6])
```
