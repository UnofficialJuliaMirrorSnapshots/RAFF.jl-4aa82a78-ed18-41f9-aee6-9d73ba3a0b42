# Overview



This page is devoted to document and make easier the use of RAFF- **R**obust 
**A**lgebraic **F**itting **F**unction. Our intent is provide a package 
to determine fitting functions for a dataset with ability to detect possible 
outliers of the dataset. All scripts were made in 
[Julia language](https://julialang.org), version 1.0. 

This package is not an implentation of classical least square solvers. In fact, 
RAFF is a solver for Low Order Value Problem [1] which is a generalization of least
square problems. 

## Current Status

The current status of this project is beta quality, don't use for anything important. 
We provide support to serial and parallel running.
