# Overview



This page is devoted to document and make easier the use of RAFF-
**R**obust **A**lgebraic **F**itting **F**unction. Our intent is to
provide a package to determine fitting functions for a dataset with
ability to detect possible outliers of the dataset. All the code was
made in [Julia language](https://julialang.org), version 1.0.

This package is not an implentation of classical least square
solvers. In fact, `RAFF` is a solver for Low Order Value Problem [1]
which is a generalization of least square problems.

## Current Status

The current status of this project is beta quality, don't use for
anything important.  We provide support to serial and parallel
running.

## Developed by

This project was developed by the optimization group at Department of
Mathematics, State University of Maringá, Brazil
